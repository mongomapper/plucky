# Plucky

A thin layer over the ruby driver that allows you to quickly grab hold of your data (pluck it!).

Used as a query selector inside of MongoMapper.

## Install

```
gem install plucky
```

## Examples

See `examples/query.rb`.

## Notes

- if you are using Ruby >= 3.4 and Rails <= 7.0, you'll need to add the bigdecimal gem to your Gemfile

## Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
